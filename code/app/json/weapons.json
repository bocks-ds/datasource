When the weapon connects with a target,  the kinetic force fires scattergun shells into the target and  deal impressive bludgeoning damage. Mercenaries favor these  weapons for fighting at close quarters, and pirates sometimes use  them to make their punches all the more dramatic. Shell knuckles  are available in tactical, advanced, elite, and paragon models.</p>",

A tank found at the butt of the spear allows substances  to be poured into the weapon, and a spring-loaded mechanism  automatically injects foes upon striking a  successful blow.
