Fire resistance or immunity does not apply to the holy energy portion of the damage.<br/> <strong>Talavet:</strong> As a move action, you can grant yourself a bonus as if an ally had succeeded at an aid another check or successfully used cover fire against a foe of your choice. This doesn't stack with any use of those options. Once you have used this ability, you can't use it again until you spend 1 Resolve Point during a 10-minute rest to regain Stamina Points.<br/> <strong>Triune:</strong> You can use a computer without having a user interface or hacking kit simply by touching it. You must still succeed at a Computers check to hack it if you do not have authorized access. Additionally, you have limited telepathy that functions only with constructs with the technological subtype.<br/> <strong>Urgathoa:</strong> Once per day as a swift action, you can force a creature of your choice within 60 feet that is subject to a disease to immediately attempt a save against that disease as if enough time had passed to fulfill its frequency. The subject suffers the normal consequences of a failed save against the disease, but a successful save does not count toward a number of successful saves needed to end the disease.<br/> <strong>Weydan:</strong> Whenever you first arrive on a new planet, you can select an appearance for yourself when you are on that planet. This becomes your natural appearance when on that planet (though you can use Disguise to alter this new appearance normally). This new appearance must be of the same type and subtype as your race, but you can change any other details. Anyone attempting to recognize you based on some other appearance must succeed at a Perception check with a DC equal to 20 + 1-1/2 x your character level.<br/> <strong>Yaraesa:</strong> You can roll a skill check to recall knowledge twice and take the better of the two results. Once you have used this ability, you can't use it again until you spend 1 Resolve Point during a 10-minute rest to regain Stamina Points.<br/> <strong>Zon-Kuthon:</strong> When you cast a spell or make an attack that deals damage, you can grant that spell or attack the pain descriptor. When you damage a creature with a pain effect, as a reaction, you can cause it to become flat-footed for 1 round. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you spend 1 Resolve Point during a 10-minute rest to regain Stamina Points.</p>",
